            The **MAT Smart Car Parking System** is an automated solution
            designed to streamline parking management using sensors,
            microcontrollers, and real-time monitoring. By detecting vehicle
            presence through IR or ultrasonic sensors, the system guides drivers
            to available slots via LED indicators or a mobile app, reducing
            search time and congestion. It integrates barrier controls, digital
            payment options, and centralized tracking to optimize space
            utilization, enhance security, and minimize human intervention.
            Ideal for smart cities, malls, and corporate campuses, this system
            improves efficiency, reduces emissions, and ensures a hassle-free
            parking experience.
